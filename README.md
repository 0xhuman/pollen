# Pollen: USSD Savings Circles ü¶Ñ üåç üöÄ 

## *(TL;DR) üîë*
*[Pollen](https://www.fourthlinelimited.com/finance) is a platform for African farmers to access finanical üí∏, crop üå±, and weather services üå¶. Specifically, Pollen allows users to participate in digital savings circles (aka village banking), check the weekly forecast, and find local buyers for their crops. Pollen uses Unstructured Supplementary Service Data [(USSD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data) to reach users without a smartphone or internet access and maximize prosperity. This is done with a PHP server and MySQL database. To manage user funds in a secure, transparent, and trustless manor, we use the [Celo Blockchain](https://www.celo.org). Mobile-money (i.e. [M-Pesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa)) serves as the on- and off-ramps to cUSD, a stablecoin on Celo that is pegged to the US Dollar. This architecture can be expanded beyond savings circles to include interest-barring savings, lotteries, round-up savings, crypto investing, and much more üöÄ*
